## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing
1. Clone the repository: <br>

       $ git clone https://github.com/abeltavares/python_challanges.git 

2. Navigate to the repository: <br>

       $ cd python-challenges 

3. Run the code for a specific challenge:<br>

       $ python challenge.py

## Challenges

The challenges are divided by difficulty level, with `1kyu` being the hardest and `8kyu` being the easiest. The challenges can be found in the challenges directory, which is organized into subdirectories for each difficulty level.
Each challenge has its own separate folder inside the difficulty level directory, which contains a description of the task in a text file and my solution in a Python file.

More challenges will be added as I complete them.

## Contributing

If you have a better solution or find a bug, feel free to open a pull request or issue. I'm always looking to improve my code and learn new things!
